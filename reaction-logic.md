# Reaction Logic — BECIA Interaction Protocol (BIP)

This document explains **why the same emoji can trigger completely different emotions** in different receivers, and how the BECIA Interaction Protocol (BIP) models this process.

BIP treats emojis as **nonverbal interaction triggers**, not static sentiment labels.

---

# 1. Core Idea

Emotional interpretation is dynamic.

A receiver’s reaction depends on six interacting factors:

**Reaction ≈  
Intention × Relationship × Context × State × Physiology × Environment**

Changes in any dimension can flip the meaning of the same emoji.

---

# 2. Sender vs Receiver Interpretation

BIP separates two layers:

- **Sender Intention:**  
  What emotion or tone the sender *meant* to express.

- **Receiver Reaction:**  
  What emotion the receiver is *likely to feel* based on their internal and external state.

The same emoji can move from:
- humour → humiliation  
- affection → sadness  
- flirt → contempt  
- softening → irritation  

---

# 3. Relationship Context

Relationship is one of the strongest determiners of meaning.

Examples:

| Relationship | Likely Interpretation of Emojis |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| close friend | humour = safe, teasing = playful |
| acquaintance | humour may feel risky or awkward |
| romantic partner | hearts = intimacy, smirk = flirt |
| ex-partner | hearts = pain, smirk = hostility |
| colleague/rival | laughing emojis may feel mocking |
| authority figure | ellipsis may feel threatening |

---

# 4. Emotional State of the Receiver

The receiver’s **baseline state** radically changes interpretation:

| State | Effect on Emojis |
|-------|------------------|
| calm | messages read more positively |
| stressed | humour feels heavy or annoying |
| lonely | hearts may evoke sadness |
| overwhelmed | smirks feel harsher |
| insecure | teasing feels like criticism |
| connected | warmth is amplified |

Emojis pass through the “emotional filter” of the receiver.

## Physiology

Physiology refers to the sender’s and receiver’s physical and bodily state at the moment of communication.  
It shapes how tone is produced and how it is perceived.  
Physiological factors can amplify, soften, distort or redirect emotional signals in text.

Typical physiological influences include:

- fatigue or sleep deprivation  
- physical pain or discomfort  
- sensory overload (noise, brightness, multitasking)  
- overstimulation or understimulation  
- hormonal load, stress spikes, agitation  
- illness, injury, migraine, tension  

Physiology modifies interpretation patterns:

- mild teasing when the sender is exhausted → can be read as irritability  
- neutral wording when the receiver is stressed → may be read as rejection  
- excessive emoji use during overstimulation → may imitate emotional “loudness”  

Physiology does not directly change the linguistic form,  
but it **changes the perceived strength and direction of tone and intention**.

### How Physiology is Inferred in Text

Physiology is not guessed “intuitively”.  
It is inferred from measurable linguistic and behavioural signals that typically correlate with physical or sensory states.

Common textual indicators include:

- **response time patterns** (very fast, very delayed, inconsistent)  
- **message length shifts** (short, abrupt replies vs unusually long rants)  
- **interruption markers** (“—”, sudden topic drops, broken sentences)  
- **inconsistent punctuation** (overuse of “!!!”, “…”, lack of punctuation)  
- **spikes in profanity** (frustration, agitation, reduced self-regulation)  
- **typos and autocorrect errors** (fatigue, distraction, sensory overload)  
- **reduced emoji use** (low energy, emotional flattening)  
- **excessive emoji use** (overstimulation, agitation, heightened arousal)  
- **switching between tones** (cognitive overload, stress)  
- **single-word replies** (“ok”, “yeah”, “fine”) indicating low capacity or exhaustion  

These signals do not diagnose physiology.  
They simply provide **patterns** that help determine how a message is likely to be read  
(e.g., tired person → softer tone, stressed person → harsher reading).

Physiology is therefore treated as **an interpretive modifier**,  
derived from text structure and timing rather than explicit content.

## Environment

Environment describes the situational context in which the message is exchanged.  
It includes physical surroundings, social setting, digital context and the ongoing dynamic of the conversation.

Environmental factors include:

- home vs work vs public space  
- private chat vs group chat  
- calm setting vs chaotic or fragmented attention  
- day vs late-night messaging  
- presence of external pressure (tasks, deadlines, conflict)  
- noise, distractions, interruptions  

Environment influences interpretation by shifting expectations:

- chaotic group chat → softer reading of abrupt tone  
- emotionally charged setting → harsher interpretation of vagueness  
- late-night conversation → higher sensitivity to subtle cues  
- public or formal setting → reduced openness, stronger filtering of tone  

Environment frames how the message should be read,  
because it **changes the baseline assumptions** of tone, intention and reaction.

### How Environment is Inferred in Text

Environment is inferred from contextual, temporal and conversational patterns  
that reveal where the sender is, what is happening around them,  
and what social or situational constraints shape the message.

Common environmental indicators include:

#### **1. Temporal cues**
- messaging at **unusual hours** (late night → heightened sensitivity, lowered inhibition)  
- rapid-fire exchanges vs long gaps  
- work-hour patterns vs weekend patterns  
- sudden silence during expected availability  

#### **2. Conversational structure**
- **fragmented replies** (divided attention, multitasking)  
- abrupt topic changes  
- mixing formal and informal tone  
- messages cut mid-thought (“—”, “wait”, “brb”)  
- repeated re-clarifications (“what?”, “sorry?” → noise or distraction)  

#### **3. Social context signals**
- presence of group dynamics (replying as if multiple people are watching)  
- softened tone in public or semi-public settings  
- over-politeness → workplace environment  
- avoidance of emotional markers → formal context or reduced privacy  

#### **4. Physical environment indicators**
- references to movement (“on the bus”, “running”, “driving”)  
- inconsistent typing rhythm (typing while walking or distracted)  
- environment-induced mistakes (autocorrect chaos, duplicated words)  
- shorter, clipped replies → crowded or noisy surroundings  

#### **5. Emotional atmosphere cues**
- heightened sensitivity during conflict situations  
- aggressive tone “leaking” after prior tension  
- overly controlled wording → formal or stressful setting  
- muted tone → public place, around other people, or limited privacy  

Environment is not explicitly stated in most messages.  
It is inferred from **patterns of timing, message structure, tone shifts, response behaviour, and social positioning**.

Environment acts as a **contextual frame** that adjusts interpretation:  
a message written at midnight in silence is not read the same way  
as a message written at work, on a bus, or during a group conversation.

# 5. Social Meaning of Emojis (Signal Role)

Emojis encode nonverbal social functions:

- inclusion vs exclusion  
- superiority vs equality  
- intimacy vs distance  
- playful vs serious  
- public-performance vs private emotion  

Receivers infer **the social role** of the emoji, not just its shape.

---

# 6. Context Modifiers

The situation heavily shapes interpretation:

| Context | Reaction Pattern |
|---------|------------------|
| emotional topic | humour may feel inappropriate |
| argument | smirk intensifies conflict |
| apology | ellipsis may feel threatening |
| celebration | hearts feel supportive |
| disclosure | soft emojis reduce tension |
| correction | 😂 can feel humiliating |

---

# 7. Physiology Modifiers

Human physiology strongly affects emotional tolerance.

### 7.1 Fatigue
- humour becomes irritating  
- teasing feels harsher  
- hearts feel too intense  
- ellipsis increases anxiety  

### 7.2 Illness / Physical discomfort
- emotional resilience is low  
- jokes fall flat  
- teasing feels aggressive  
- even neutral emojis can be misread  

### 7.3 Hunger / pain / sensory overload
- sharper reactions  
- low patience  
- negative bias

---

# 8. Environmental Modifiers

Examples:

### 8.1 Weather  
- sunlight → more positive interpretation  
- cold/rain → lower mood, harsher reading  

### 8.2 Noise / crowd / smell  
- tolerance decreases  
- soft emojis feel fake  
- teasing feels hostile  

### 8.3 Safety vs discomfort  
- safe environment → empathetic reading  
- uncomfortable environment → defensive reading  

---

# 9. Emoji-by-Emoji Reaction Patterns

### 9.1 😂 — Full Laugh

**Positive (shared humour):**
- safe relationship  
- mutual joke  
- receiver stable  

**Negative (feeling mocked):**
- insecurity  
- public context  
- power imbalance  
- joke “at them”  

---

### 9.2 😅 — Soft Laugh (Half😂)

**Positive:**  
gentle humour, polite embarrassment, softener  

**Negative:**  
downplaying seriousness, avoidance, “don’t do that”  

---

### 9.3 😏 — Smirk

**Positive:**  
flirt, playful dominance, confident tease  

**Negative:**  
condescension, elegant mockery, polite attack  

---

### 9.4 ❤️ — Red Heart

**Positive:**  
deep affection, connection, trust  

**Negative:**  
sadness, jealousy, longing, grief  

---

### 9.5 🩷 — Pink Heart

**Positive:**  
friendly warmth, gentle support  

**Negative:**  
too sweet, insincere, performative  

---

### 9.6 `…` — Ellipsis

**Positive:**  
soft pause, gentle hesitation, emotional space  

**Negative:**  
threat, judgment, emotional withdrawal

# 10. Summary Rule for Annotation

When annotating:

> **Meaning is not the emoji.  
> Meaning is the interaction between  
> Intention, Relationship, Context, State, Physiology, and Environment.**

Because all six factors vary between individuals,  
**emoji interpretation is inherently personal, contextual and dynamic.**

## 11. Intentionality and Reaction Mismatch (Becia v1.1)

Becia v1.1 explicitly separates:

- **tone** – how the message sounds on the surface,
- **intention** – what the sender is trying to achieve socially,
- **reaction** – how the receiver is likely to feel or respond.

In practice:

> Perceived meaning = f(text, emojis, relationship, context, sender_state, receiver_state, intention)

Two messages can share the same tone but differ in intention:

- teasing that maintains closeness  
- teasing that creates distance

And the same intention can lead to different reactions depending on the receiver:

- “softening a refusal” may be read as considerate  
- or as passive-aggressive, if trust is low.

For BECIA v1.1 the annotator should:

1. Infer the **primary intention** (if possible).  
2. Describe the **likely reaction** in `context_note`.  
3. Optionally mark when intention and reaction are clearly misaligned.

Typical mismatch patterns:

- intention: reassurance → reaction: still anxious  
- intention: distancing politely → reaction: feeling rejected  
- intention: humour to mask tension → reaction: confusion or hurt  

This keeps reaction logic grounded in social reality, not only in surface-level emotion.
