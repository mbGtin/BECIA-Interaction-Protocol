# Reaction Logic — BECIA Interaction Protocol (BIP)
### Version: v1.1 (Intentionality Update)

This document explains how the **BECIA Interaction Protocol (BIP)** models  
the receiver’s emotional reaction to a message based on:

- emojis  
- tone  
- communicative intention  
- relationship  
- context  
- emotional baseline  
- physiology  
- environment  

BIP treats emojis as **interaction triggers**, not fixed sentiment markers.

---

# 1. Core Idea

Emotional interpretation is **dynamic**, not static.

A receiver’s reaction is shaped by six interacting factors:

```
Reaction ≈ Intention × Relationship × Context × State × Physiology × Environment
```

Changing any factor can flip meaning:

- humour → humiliation  
- teasing → hostility  
- affection → sadness  
- softening → passive-aggressiveness  

---

# 2. Sender vs Receiver Interpretation

BIP **separates**:

### ■ Sender Intention  
What the sender *meant* to communicate.

### ■ Receiver Reaction  
What emotion the receiver is *likely* to experience.

This difference is crucial:  
the same emoji may comfort one person and hurt another.

---

# 3. Relationship Context

Relationship heavily modulates meaning.

| Relationship | Likely Reaction to Emojis |
|-------------|---------------------------|
| close friend | teasing = playful |
| acquaintance | teasing = risky |
| partner | heart = intimacy |
| ex-partner | heart = pain or confusion |
| colleague | 😂 may feel mocking |
| authority | ellipsis may feel threatening |

Interpretation is never “emoji-only”.

---

# 4. Emotional State of the Receiver

The **baseline** state changes the emotional filter:

| State | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| calm | messages read positively |
| stressed | humour feels heavy |
| lonely | hearts can feel sad |
| overwhelmed | smirks feel harsher |
| insecure | teasing feels like criticism |
| connected | warmth is amplified |

---

# 5. Physiology

Physiology affects tone perception and emotional tolerance.

Factors:

- fatigue  
- illness  
- hunger  
- physical pain  
- sensory overload  
- overstimulation  
- hormonal stress  
- lack of sleep  

**Effects:**

- teasing may feel aggressive  
- humour may feel irritating  
- ellipsis increases anxiety  
- emoji intensity feels “too loud”  

### How physiology is inferred:

- response delays or abrupt replies  
- typos and autocorrect errors  
- inconsistent punctuation  
- message length shifts  
- spikes in profanity  
- tone switching  
- reduced or excessive emoji use  

These cues **do not diagnose** anything — they simply inform interpretation.

---

# 6. Environment

Environment includes:

- public vs private  
- noise level  
- movement (on the bus, walking)  
- work vs home  
- late-night vs daytime  
- group chat vs private chat  

**Effects:**

- fragmented attention = softer reading  
- public setting = reduced openness  
- emotional topics at night = stronger sensitivity  
- noisy or stressful environment = harsher tone perception  

### Inference cues:

- time of message  
- message fragmentation  
- sudden silence  
- switching between formal/informal  
- mixed clarity  
- short, clipped replies  

---

# 7. Social Meaning of Emojis

Emojis perform **social actions**, not emotional labels.

Examples:

- 😂😂😂 = bonding or humiliation  
- ❤️ = trust or grief  
- 😏 = flirt or condescension  
- … = gentle pause or silent judgment  

Meaning depends on the **interaction**, not the symbol.

---

# 8. Context Modifiers

| Context | Reaction Pattern |
|---------|------------------|
| apology | ellipsis feels threatening |
| correction | 😂 feels humiliating |
| celebration | hearts feel supportive |
| argument | smirk intensifies conflict |
| disclosure | soft emojis reduce tension |
| insecurity | teasing feels hostile |

---

# 9. Physiology Modifiers (Detailed)

### 9.1 Fatigue  
- low emotional tolerance  
- sharper reading  
- teasing feels heavy  
- warmth feels overwhelming  

### 9.2 Illness / discomfort  
- resilience drops  
- neutral tone may feel cold  
- emojis feel intense or misplaced  

### 9.3 Hunger / sensory overload  
- irritability  
- impulsivity  
- reduced patience  

---

# 10. Environmental Modifiers (Detailed)

### Weather  
- sunlight → positive bias  
- cold/rain → negative bias  

### Noise / crowd  
- negativity bias increases  
- soft emojis feel fake  
- humour feels irritating  

### Privacy  
- private: open, soft interpretations  
- public: guarded, defensive interpretations

# 12. Summary Rule for Annotation

> **Meaning is the interaction between  
> Intention, Relationship, Context, State, Physiology and Environment —  
> not the emoji alone.**

This is why emoji interpretation is inherently **contextual, personal and dynamic**.

---

# 13. Intentionality & Reaction Mismatch (v1.1)

BECIA v1.1 explicitly separates:

- **tone** → surface sound  
- **intention** → social motive  
- **reaction** → emotional impact  

Typical mismatch patterns:

- reassurance → receiver still anxious  
- softening refusal → receiver feels rejected  
- humour masking tension → receiver feels confused or hurt  
- teasing for closeness → receiver feels attacked  

Intentionality captures the *why*.  
Reaction captures the *impact*.

Both are essential for true human-aligned interpretation.
