# Emoji Semantics — BECIA Interaction Protocol (BIP)

This document describes how emojis function as **nonverbal signals** rather than static emotion labels.

Emojis are treated as:
- tone markers  
- relational cues  
- social signals  
- emotional intensifiers  
- nonverbal triggers  

They compress facial expressions, attitude, emotional intensity, and subtle human behaviour into a single symbol.

# 1. Nonverbal Function of Emojis

Emojis mirror offline nonverbal communication:

- facial expression  
- micro-expression  
- tension / relaxation  
- attitude  
- emotional intensity  
- inclusion vs exclusion  
- flirtation vs contempt  
- softening vs sharpening tone  

They are **not decorative icons**, but **compressed behavioural signals**.

## 2.7 Other Hearts (💛💚🧡💜🤍🖤)

These hearts operate primarily through **context**:

| Emoji | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 💚 | eco themes, nature, “green energy” |
| 💛 | light positivity, cheerful, sunny |
| 🧡 | warm but less intimate than ❤️ |
| 💜 | solidarity, support, aesthetics |
| 🤍 | purity, calm, condolences |
| 🖤 | goth, dark humour, mourning |

They indicate **mood**, not deep personal emotion.

# 3. Ellipsis — `…` as a Nonverbal Marker

The ellipsis functions as a *nonverbal emotional signal*:

- hesitation  
- doubt  
- discomfort  
- implied continuation  
- emotional pause  
- softening  
- subtle tension  

Examples:
- “Sure… if you say so.”  
- “I’m fine… really.”  
- “Oh. Okay…”  

Almost never neutral.

# 4. Emojis as Emotional Triggers

Nonverbal signals **not only express** emotions —  
they also **evoke** emotions in the receiver.

Examples:

- 😂😂😂 → joy for insiders, humiliation for outsiders  
- ❤️ → warmth for some, sadness/jealousy for others  
- 😏 → flirt for some, condescension for others  
- 🩷 → comfort or “too sweet”  
- … → safe pause or ominous silence  

Interpretation depends on:
- relationship  
- emotional state  
- comfort  
- insecurity  
- context  
- physiology  

This variability is modelled in `reaction_logic.md`.

# 5. Summary

Emojis = compressed nonverbal behaviour.

BIP treats each emoji as:
- a social action  
- an emotional cue  
- a relational signal  
- an interaction trigger  

Not as a static “emotion label”.

## 6. Intentionality Notes (Becia v1.1)

Emoji do not encode emotion alone — they often carry a communicative intention.

Examples:
- 😊 used to soften a critical or doubtful message  
- 😅 used to hide tension while appearing playful  
- … used to distance softly without rejecting  
- 😏 used to maintain closeness through teasing  

In BECIA v1.1 the interpretation of an emoji depends on:
**Intention × Relationship × Context × State × Expected Reaction**

This extends emoji semantics from emotional labels to communicative functions.
