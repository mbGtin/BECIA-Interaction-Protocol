# Emoji Semantics — BECIA Interaction Protocol (BIP)
### Version: v1.1

This document describes how emojis function under the  
**BECIA Interaction Protocol (BIP)** as *nonverbal signals*, not static emotional labels.

Emojis in BIP encode:

- facial expression  
- micro-expression  
- attitude  
- emotional intensity  
- relational meaning  
- softening or sharpening of tone  

They act as compressed behavioural cues.

# 1. Nonverbal Function of Emojis

Emojis mirror offline nonverbal communication:

- tension / relaxation  
- playfulness vs seriousness  
- closeness vs distance  
- dominance vs submission  
- inclusion vs exclusion  

Emojis rarely express a single “emotion”.  
They function as **social signals**.

# 3. Ellipsis `…` as a Nonverbal Marker

# 4. Emojis as Emotional Triggers

Emojis not only express emotion — they **evoke** emotional reactions in the receiver.

Examples:

- 😂😂😂 → bonding for insiders, humiliation for outsiders  
- ❤️ → warmth for some, sadness/jealousy for others  
- 😏 → flirt or condescension depending on relationship  
- … → soft pause or threatening silence  

Interpretation depends on:

- relationship  
- insecurity vs confidence  
- fatigue/stress  
- privacy vs public setting  
- topic sensitivity  

This variability is modelled in `reaction_logic.md`.

# 5. Summary

Emojis in BIP serve as:

- emotional cues  
- relational signals  
- intensity markers  
- softeners/sharpeners  
- interaction triggers  

They are not static labels but dynamic components of human-aligned interpretation.

# 6. Intentionality Notes (v1.1)

Emojis often signal **communicative intention**, not emotion alone.

Examples:

- 😊 softening criticism  
- 😅 hiding tension  
- … distancing without rejecting  
- 😏 maintaining playful closeness  

Intentionality interacts with:

```
Intention × Relationship × Context × State × Expected Reaction
```

This expands emoji semantics from *emotion* to *social function*.
