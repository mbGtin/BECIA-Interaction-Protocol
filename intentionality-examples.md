### Summary

Intentionality focuses on **why** the message was shaped in this particular way, not just **what** emotion is visible on the surface.

It synthesises:

- Relationship  
- Context  
- State  
- Tone  
- Emoji behaviour  
- Expected reaction  

This aligns BECIA with next-generation conversational AI research.
