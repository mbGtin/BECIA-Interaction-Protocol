# Intentionality Examples — BECIA v1.1
### Communicative Motives in Emoji-Based Interaction

The **intentionality layer** in BECIA v1.1 captures  
*why the sender shaped the message the way they did*.

Tone shows **how** it sounds.  
Intention shows **why** it was done.  
Reaction shows **how the receiver is likely to feel**.

Below are clean, minimal examples.

# Summary

Intentionality identifies the **function** of the message:

```
Intention = social motive 
            (reassurance, distancing, teasing, softening, masking, signalling)
```

It interacts with:

```
Intention × Relationship × Context × State × Reaction
```

and allows BECIA to represent not only tone,  
but the *reason* behind the tone —  
a critical component of human-aligned communication modeling.
